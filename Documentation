Core Units
	- Product 
		variables = name, prize, stock,id (self_generating)
		Methods
			Update()
				~ Name, prize, stock
			

	- Product Management
		variables = Product objects list
		Methods
			Fetch products() - Product list
			delete_product() - Product deleting request to db unit
			fetch_product() - return product object -- edit with product object
			edit_product() - Editing product

	- DB unit
	features - Consistency in Data base for Ensuring persistent storage of data

	variables = transactions, Product list
	methods
		add_products
		remove_product
		update_product
DB unit works with product manager to carry out operations

## Testing and units development
DB_Manager
  - Working to make edits and DB modification
  - Product Object
      * Works at initiating product DB
      * Connecting with DB to fetch Product for display
      * Handles operations at Product level and manage dataset
      * handeling dataset, Handeling modificaitons and updates

------------------------------------------------------------- 
Units development update : 30 december, 2025


Objects working and usage documentation
Product works with data dictionary
  Dictionary -> { name : Laptop, prize : 1919, stock: 929}
  Product.update(target_id, edit_list) makes edits of the product unit

------------------------------ 

CUREENT KNOWN TARGETS

1. Make Product Object robust and connect well with DB for good communication -- Completed
2. DB-integration | Product to manage its content and stocks -- Comleted
3. User object integration --> Generalise DB-Manager for working with user and product | almost done
4. Initiating Transaction DB for simplicity with completing Whole Backend | almost done -- one critical to solve 

Critical || Make initiation pathway with id in general DB object to insure we make bill and complete transaction

Back end almost completed with the above requirement of completing transaction final end point


+ make very simple working asthetic frontend


-------------------------------------
Issues and Problems to solve
Feilds is being initiated with object details in general object thus fix it it take feilds as different
	- Potential bugs and cascade , user and products initiation way have to be updated and update product initiation also
  - Fixed bugs but needs refactorations

-------------------------------------
CODE NOT TESTED WITH EDGE CASES
last feature required -- > add transaction syncs with DB end to make persistent history of transaction and trace user history
